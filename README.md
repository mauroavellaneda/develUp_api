# Our goal

DevelUp was born with the simple idea of providing a platform that connects freelance developers with companies in a trustworthy and score based environment


# How do we achieve our goal? 

The idea is as follows:  the companies, will publish a task that they need to perform. On the other side, the 'developers' will be able to see the tasks and apply to them if they are interested.

The companies, in turn, will be able to see in each of the tasks they have published, the number of developers who have applied and choose one of them.

And this is where the most important part of the application comes in: our system of scores and levels.

Each task that companies publish will have a number of points that will be the result of two parameters: the chosen programming languages and the necessary number of days in which they want to have their tasks ready.
The more complex the language and the more days to complete the task, the higher the score

This amount of points will be obtained by the chosen developer, once the task is delivered and the client is satisfied.


 # what will happen next with these points?

Developers will be able to scale levels based on the amount of points they have, and by doing so, we want to obtain a system where the levels of the developers represent their skills and therefore, companies can trust in them and in our system.

This is the reason why we name our application 'develUp'
